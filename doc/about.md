The xd crossword corpus started as a model "small data" project, a test of my claims that simple formats and obsessive curation are [unreasonably effective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences) in the data sciences.

Since the project did uncover some [malfeasance](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/gaming/2016/03/how_to_spot_a_plagiarized_crossword.html), it seems important to have an ongoing process for analyzing crosswords, to encourage originality and proper attribution.

The xd [design](/doc) is intentionally textpunk and therefore platform-agnostic. Anyone can contribute or consume data with only a few minutes of work.
