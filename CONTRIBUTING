Notes:

[ tox ]
This creates a virtualenv and runs tests against the package.
- tox requires MANIFEST.in to locate files to copy into the virtualenv test environments.

[ tests ]
To execute tests, run tox or 'python setup.py test'

[ style ]
Line length: 90-ish is OK, flake8 is set to 95.

[ setup ]
Test the setup with a dry run: 'python setup.py install -n'
