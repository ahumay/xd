PRE-REQUISITES:
OS:
Linux/Mac OSX; Not tested in Windows - but it shouldn't be that hard supporting it

Softwares:
* Python
* PIP

SET UP:
1. Copy the zip file over to some local directory and extract it
2. Install all the dependency modules with PIP
* Open the terminal
* Navigate to the directory where the zip file has been extracted - `cd`
* Execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` (as of now, we do not have any external requirements so we dont have a requirements.txt and so you can skip this step)

EXECUTION:
1. Open a terminal

2. Navigate to the directory where the zip file has been extracted - `cd`

3. Execute main.py

* Usage 1 - Download RAW Format Crosswords:
`python main.py --download-raw --scraper <SCRAPER_NAME> --outfile <OUTFILE> --from-date <DD-MM-YYYY> --to-date <DD-MM-YYYY>`
ex. `python main.py --download-raw --scraper LATimesScraper --outfile x.zip --from-date 01-01-2016 --to-date 10-01-2016`
ex. `python main.py --download-raw -s LATimesScraper -o x.zip -f 01-01-2016 -t 10-01-2016`

* Usage 2 - Download XD Format Crosswords:
`python main.py --download-xd --scraper <SCRAPER_NAME> --outfile <OUTFILE> --from-date <DD-MM-YYYY> --to-date <DD-MM-YYYY>`
ex. `python main.py --download-xd --scraper LATimesScraper --outfile x.zip --from-date 01-01-2016 --to-date 10-01-2016`
ex. `python main.py --download-xd -s LATimesScraper -o x.zip -f 01-01-2016 -t 10-01-2016`

* Usage 3 - Convert RAW Format Crosswords to XD Format Crosswords:
`python main.py --raw-to-xd --scraper <SCRAPER_NAME> --infile <INFILE> --outfile <OUTFILE>`
ex. `python main.py --raw-to-xd --scraper LATimesScraper --infile x.zip --outfile y.zip`
ex. `python main.py --raw-to-xd -s LATimesScraper -i x.zip -o y.zip`

4. How to write and plug in a new scraper (for a new website)?

* All you have to do is write a Python module for the scraper and make sure it implements the following methods (same signature) -
** get_content(self, date)
  This method should be able to build a website specific URL and retrive content from the web (you can use URLUtils to facilitate download)
  Throw NoCrosswordError or ContentDownloadError appropriately, just in case
** build_crossword(self, content)
  This method should build and return a valid Crossword instance (import from crosswords.py module)
** RAW_CONTENT_TYPE, FILENAME_PREFIX
  These constants are to be overridden as well (the names are self explanatory)

* Import your scraper in scrapers/__init__.py so that it is directly accessible

* After this you can just execute main.py as you usually would and everything should work as is.

* The Core module is capable to converting and writing RAW/XD Crossword files with just these info.

* If the new scraper has any dependencies (like on 3rd party Python modules), make sure to add it to the requirements.txt file
